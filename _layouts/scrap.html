        <span class="bold">CSS</span> and <span class="bold">JQUERY</span>. At other times i had to create new functionality for the websites. Most of the work
        was done on my own, with me having to contact clients to discuss new design and functionality.

         During the last year of my studies, I had the choice of either applying for an internship
         in Sweden or to travel to China to help western companies to create product designs for
         products to be released in China. I choose to go to China, which had me help the companies
         "Dream of Sweden" and "Guttstakälla". The work in China mostly consisted of coming up with
         conceptual ideas and web-related material for the  products.

       <p class="timepoint__text">
         During the winter half of 2013 I was doing my examination-work. Me and my collegue contacted the service
         company Husqvarna Center to see if we could help them establish themselves on the internet.
         After they had accepted we first started with researching what kind of customers the company had.
         From what we could gather about the customers we created a "persona". The persona was then used to
         create mockups with the purpose of making the website as easy as possible for the customers to use.
         Much of the work was focused around finding out what kind of best-practices there are for creating
         user interfaces.

         A year after I had started my studies, the graphical design club on the campus were looking for new members so I decided to sign up.
         This meant that I would during my free-time work with creating graphical design for poster and web related material. The time spen
         in the club was mostly used to create a temporary website in wordpress for the exhibition "Hi-Work", an exhibition for companies
         to try to recruit students to work part-time for them during their studies.

         When I wasn't working with the Hi-Work exhibition I was tasked with creating simpler graphical design material relationg to the

         During the fall of 2012 I started my first year of studying graphical design
         och webdevelopment at Jönköping School of Engineering. The program would take
         it's course during two years, with the intention to teach out basic skills in the
         adobe suite and how to develop your first website with the help of HTML, CSS
         and Javascript.

         Much of the focus of the education was put on teaching out different design
         theories such as color-theories, alignment and the golden ratio.

         The summer of 2012 was mostly spent remotely studying a 30-point course in 3D modelling.
         The course sought to teach the student the basics of 3D-modelleing in the program 3DS Max by Autodesk.
         During the final assignment the student had to modell a free-of-choice modell and then animate it.
         I choose to give my hand at modelling a catwalk modell walking down the catwalk.
