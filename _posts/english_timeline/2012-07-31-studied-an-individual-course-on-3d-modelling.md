text: "The summer of 2012 was mostly spent remotely studying a 30-point course
       in 3D modelling. The course sought to teach the student the basics of 3D modelling in the program 3DS Max by Autodesk. During the final assignment the student had to model a free-of-choice model and then animate it. I choose to give my hand at modelling a catwalk model walking down the catwalk."
