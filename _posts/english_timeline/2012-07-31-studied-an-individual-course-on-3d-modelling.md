text: "The summer of 2012 was mostly spent remotely studying a 30-point course
       in 3D modelling. The course sought to teach the student the basics of 3D-modelleing in the program 3DS Max by Autodesk. During the final assignment the student had to modell a free-of-choice modell and then animate it. I choose to give my hand at modelling a catwalk modell walking down the catwalk."
