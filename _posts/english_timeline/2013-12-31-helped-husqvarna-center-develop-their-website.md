text: "During the winter half of 2013 I was doing my examination-work. Me and my
       collegue contacted the service company Husqvarna Center to see if we could help them establish themselves on the internet. After they had accepted we first started with researching what kind of customers the company had. From what we could gather about the customers we created a 'persona'. The persona was then used to create mockups with the purpose of making the website as easy as possible for the customers to use. Much of the work was focused around finding out what kind of best-practices there are for creating user interfaces."
