text: "A year after I had started my studies, the graphical design club on the
       campus were looking for new members so I decided to sign up. This meant that I would during my free-time work with creating graphical design for poster and web related material. The time spent in the club was mostly used to create a temporary website in Wordpress for the exhibition 'Hi-Work', an exhibition for companies to try to recruit students to work part-time for them during their studies. When I wasn't working with the Hi-Work exhibition I was tasked with creating simpler graphical design material relating to the exhibition."
