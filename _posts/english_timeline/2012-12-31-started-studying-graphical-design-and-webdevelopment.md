text: "During the fall of 2012 I started my first year of studying graphical design
       och webdevelopment at Jönköping School of Engineering. The program would take it's course during two years, with the intention to teach out basic skills in the adobe suite and how to develop your first website with the help of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Much of the focus of the education was put on teaching out different design theories such as color-theories, alignment and the golden ratio."
