text: "During a period of five months, I did an internship with the
       responsibillities of supporting and developing websites that had been created before I arrived. The work was mostly done with-in the CMS Wordpress, which made me at times having to adjust front-end design with HTML, CSS and JQUERY, at other times I had to create new functionality for the websites. Most of the work was done on my own, with me having to contact clients to discuss new design and functionality."
