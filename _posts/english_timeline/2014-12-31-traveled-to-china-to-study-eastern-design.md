text: "During the last year of my studies, I had the choice of either applying for
       an internship in Sweden or to travel to China to help western companies to create product designs for products to be released in China. I choose to go to China, which had me help the companies 'Dream of Sweden' and 'Guttstak√§lla'. The work in China mostly consisted of coming up with conceptual ideas and web-related material for the  products."
